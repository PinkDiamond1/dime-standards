# Read first

These are boiler plate templates for informed consent that can be used while interviewing a respondent.
Many surveys require additional/different components in the consent based on the type of respondent (for example, minors as respondent)
or if the survey includes certain components (such as audio-taping).

This folder includes the following consent templates:

1. Written consent – This is a printable version of the consent form that contains all details including contact person in case of future issues.
2. Written consent w COVID-19 risks - This is the same as the written consent including risks for COVID-19 transmission.
3. Oral consent – This is the bare minimum from the written consent that should be read out to a respondent before starting a survey.
4. Oral consent w COVID-19 risks - This is the same as the oral consent including risks for COVID-19 transmission.
5. SMS consent - This is a succinct consent to be obtained via SMS before starting a survey.

## Applicability of consent types
The table below indicates the different types of consents and in which survey method they can be used. For each consent format, 
the preferred for survey mode is in bold. The team can pick appropriate consent format based on the requirements in the field.

|    Consent type    |      Survey Mode       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Written consent    | **CAPI**                   |
| Electronic consent | CAPI, CATI, **CAWI**, SMS  |
| Oral consent       | CAPI, **CATI**             |
| SMS consent        | CAPI, CATI, CAWI, **SMS**  |

Electronic consent is the same as written consent but collected via an electronic format instead of on paper. 

Note that, in case of electronic consent and SMS consent, it should be sent out to respondents before survey starts (ideally the day before)

Most IRBs require that the entire written consent is shared with the participants and their signature is taken on another copy
retained by the research team. 

In cases that the written consent is too long to read out,
we recommend reading out the oral consent to respondents and giving them a printed copy of the written consent.
Note that the exact practice can vary based on the what has been agreed upon in the approved IRB protocol.
It is essential to follow the guidelines set in the IRB.

### Consent Contents

As deliniated by the Data Privacy Policy at the World Bank, an informed consent is required to include
(1) the type of Personal Data to be Processed; 
(2) the identity of the WBG Institution Processing the Personal Data; 
(3) whether the Personal Data is to be shared with Third Parties and the names or types of such Third Parties; 
(4) the specific purpose(s) for which the Personal Data is Processed; 
(5) the types of Processing activities that may be performed on the Personal Data; and 
(6) how long the Personal Data is retained.

Projects with applicable risk points must employ two or more of the items listed below.
The higher the risk, the more extensive the informed consent procedures must be, such as the following: 

- Verbal consent that is recorded 
- Notification by an impartial third party 
- Both written and oral communications, with appropriate translations 
- Reminders throughout the interaction or intervention 
- Written materials that can be kept 
- Signed consent form 
- Consent specific to the recording medium (e.g., videotape)


## Surveying minors
When surveying minors (aged 8 to 17), an assent needs to be obtained from a parent or guardian unless an exemption is provided by the IRB. This [template](https://couhes.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Assent-Form-2019-01-22.doc) can be used to develop an assent form. As detailed in the World Bank Data Privacy policy guidelines "minors under 18 or individuals under legal guardianship should be given the opportunity to assent to the use of their data whenever they are capable of doing so. The assent process should use language and processes suitable to the age and understanding of the respondent."

In case a World Bank project defines that there is a case made to not obtain assent from a parent or guardian, an approval will be required from the Data Privacy Office (DPO).
