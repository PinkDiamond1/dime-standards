# DIME STC/STT Non-Disclosure Agreement
<br><br>

I, ________________________________ [print name of STC/STT], have agreed to maintain full confidentiality when contributing to research projects at DIME. 	


## PART 1

By signing this document, I acknowledge my responsibilities to:


1. Keep all research information shared with me confidential.
Therefore, I have committed to not discussing or sharing any information in any form or format
(e.g., files, drives, transcripts, photos)
with anyone outside the research team (as defined by the Principal Investigator),
and to only share information outside the research team if
specifically requested to do so in writing by the Principal Investigator;

2. Hold in strictest confidence the identity or identifying information of any individual
that may be revealed while performing the research tasks;

3. Not make copies of any non-published data in any form or format
(e.g., drives, tapes, transcripts),
unless specifically requested to do so by the Principal Investigator;

4. Keep all _personal data_ stored in any form or format (e.g., files, drives, tapes, transcripts) secure
both when transferred to me and while it is in my possession.
Examples of personal data includes both straightforwardly identifying data,
such as name, address, and personal identification number,
as well as less straightforwardly identifying data,
such as location data, online identification data such as an internet protocol (IP) address and cookie identifiers, and physical characteristics.
Measures required to keep data secure depends on context, but as a minimum always includes (when applicable):
    - making sure that no data is transferred to me in an insecure method
      (this applies to data collection, receiving data from research partners or other members of the research team);
    - keeping all digitized personal data in securely encrypted files;
    - password-protecting my computer and any other digital devices I use;
    - never transferring identifying information over e-mail;
    - signing out from or locking the computer containing identifying information
    when away from the computer, no matter how temporarily;
    - using headphones or a private setting if transcribing recordings;

5. Destroy all personal data at when the data retention period stated in the IRB has elapsed,
regardless if I am still working on any research tasks or not.
This does not apply to anonymized data.

6. Return all data (personal or not) stored in any physical format (e.g., drives, transcripts, photos)
to the Principal Investigator when I have completed the research tasks, or at the end of my contract;

7. Destroy all research information (personal or not) stored in any form not returnable to the Principal Investigator
(e.g., information stored on my computer hard drive)
upon completion of the research tasks, or at the end of my contract,
after I have made sure that the Principal Investigator have copies of all the data that I have local copies of.

## PART 2

By signing this document, I confirm that I understand the Letter of Appointment I have already signed, which stipulates that:

1. “All intellectual property rights in or relating to any works
produced during the course of your appointment shall belong to the World Bank”
2. “All materials produced or acquired under terms of this contract -
written, graphic, film, magnetic tape, or otherwise -
shall remain the property of the World Bank
unless such rights are explicitly relinquished by the World Bank, in writing”
3. “The World Bank retains the exclusive right to publish or disseminate
in all languages reports arising from such materials.”

Meaning that I, under no circumstances,
will publish any data or any result based on not-yet-published data or information
from my research project except at the express request of the Principal Investigator.

## PART 3

By signing this document, I confirm that I have read the
[DIME Analytics Data Security Guidelines](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/blob/master/dime-research-standards/pillar-4-data-security/dime-data-security-guidelines.md)
and that I have passed the
[DIME Data Security Assessment](https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/DataSecAssess)
(do not submit this NDA before you have passed the assessment).
I agree that I will follow those Guidelines in all my research tasks at DIME.
I also understand that it is my responsibility to stay updated on DIME Analytics Data Security Guideline
and that I am personally responsible for any data breaches resulting from failure to following those guidelines;
and that I must report any violation of those guidelines immediately to the primary investigator.

I also confirm that it is my responsibility to follow up with DIME Analytics (dimeanalytics@worldbank.org)
if there is any part of this agreement that I do not fully understand.
